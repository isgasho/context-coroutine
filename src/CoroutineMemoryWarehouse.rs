/// This design does not use a guard page (via `mprotect(PROT_NONE)`) to separate the heap and stack.
///
/// Guard pages need to be at least 1Mb to be effective (see discussion in <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/19/1>), which is probably too large for coroutines if using a design that ensures all virtual memory is physically backed.
///
/// Instead separate heap and stack memory maps are used, which isn't ideal, and does allow one coroutine to trample on another's memory.
