	/// Yields execution to this `SavedContextWrapper` (`self`).
	///
	/// The current state of execution is preserved somewhere (eg within memory reserved in the stack) and the previously saved state in the `Context` pointed to by `self` is restored and executed next.
	///
	/// This behaviour is similiar in spirit to regular function calls with the difference that the call to `resume()` only returns when someone resumes the caller in turn.
	///
	/// If called on the generated `SavedContextWrapper` result of `initialize()` then starts execution at the beginning of the `context_entry_point_function_pointer` passed to `new()`.
	///
	/// The restored and executed context will be passed a `Transfer` object whose's `data_passed_from_previously_executed_context` will be `data_to_transfer` and whose `previously_executed_context_which_yielded_to_resume_the_current_context` will be the current state of execution before preservation.
	///
	/// The returned `Transfer` struct contains the previously active `SavedContextWrapper` (`Transfer.previously_executed_context_which_yielded_to_resume_the_current_context`) and the `data_to_transfer` argument used to resume the current one (`Transfer.data_passed_from_previously_executed_context`).
	///
	/// It is your responsibility to make sure that all `data_to_transfer` that constructed in this context has been dropped properly when the last context is dropped.
