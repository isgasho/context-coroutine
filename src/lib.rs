//! #context-coroutine
//!
//! Provides coroutines using the trait `Coroutine`.
//!
//! Coroutines use a separate, special stack.
//!
//! Implement this trait and then call `Coroutine::start_coroutine()`, passing in start arguments and a stack.
//!
//! For a simple coroutine, use the stack `stacks::ProtectedStack`.
//!
//! The module `context` provides lower-level logic to use as a building block for things other than coroutines, for example, fibres.
//!
//! This crate was originally a simple set of extensions to the [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) crate to provide stackful coroutines.
//! The developers are not associated with the authors of [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) but are extremely grateful for the work they've put into to a superb piece of code.
